"""People on a hub: who may send to it and open its dashboard, and with which role. No Tailscale needed.

Roles:
    admin     sees everything, invites people and changes roles, changes the hub's settings (team store, people)
    member    their computers send to the hub and get teammates' lessons back; sees the hub's dashboard
    readonly  sees the hub's dashboard; sends nothing, changes nothing

Projects: a member or read-only person sees the projects they were given (`chronicle hub invite … --project`), or
every project (`--all-projects`). Someone limited to projects sees only those projects' session summaries and project
lessons on the dashboard (access.py), and their computers share knowledge only, only for those projects (hub.py).
Admins always see everything. People added before projects existed see every project, as they did.

Everything starts with an invite. An admin adds a person with a role and gets a one-time code (expires after
INVITE_DAYS) to pass on by chat; the hub sends no email. The code is redeemed once, either by a computer
(`chronicle hub join <hub> --code …`: it becomes a push token for that person and that computer) or by a browser
(the invite link: it becomes a dashboard session). A person's own computer can later ask for a short sign-in link
(SIGNIN_MINUTES) to open the hub's dashboard without a password.

Only hashes of codes, tokens and sessions are stored; the secret itself is shown once (codes) or lives only on the
computer (tokens) or in the browser's cookie (sessions). Removing a person, or revoking a token or session, takes
effect at the next request. Whoever is at the hub computer itself is always an admin: that is how the first admin
is made, and how a hub whose admins are all gone is recovered.

While a hub has no people, it works as before: computers send with the hub's shared token. Once it has people the
shared token keeps working until `[hub] shared_token = false` (Devices › People, or the config), so computers that
joined before are not cut off.
