"""Your own groups of projects, one level deep: a name, folder rules, and projects put in by hand.

A project's group is its hand pick when it has one (a pick can also keep it out of every group), else the group whose
folder rule is the longest one its path sits under. Picks are kept only where they differ from what the rules say,
so a project moved back where its folder puts it follows the rules again.

Groups only change how the dashboard lists projects: each project keeps its own sessions, knowledge base and hub
sharing, and groups stay in this dashboard's database (a hub never sends or receives them).
