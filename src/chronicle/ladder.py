"""Knowledge maturity: every item carries a stage that it earns by recurring across sessions.

    wip → provisional → established → canonical

A new item starts at `provisional` (`wip` when the analysis was unsure), or at `established` when Claude Code's own
memory or the user wrote it. It climbs only on evidence: synthesis reports that another session's item states the
same lesson (a duplicate), and the two items' sessions are pooled. Two distinct sessions make an item `established`;
three spread over at least two weeks, or a pin, make it `canonical`. The stage is recomputed from that evidence, never
guessed, and `stage_reason` says what earned it.

Leaving the ladder is a status change (`superseded`, `dismissed`), not a stage: a superseded item keeps the stage it
had, names its successor in `superseded_by` when there is one, and says why in `superseded_reason`. An established or
canonical item that is overturned (not merely merged as a duplicate) is listed in that week's review.
