It writes synthetic Claude Code transcripts for a fictional developer (five projects, about six weeks), then runs the
real pipeline over them: sync, analysis, knowledge bases, glossary and weekly reviews. The only stand-in is `claude`:
a small script that answers each analysis with the hand-written summary and knowledge below, so the demo costs
nothing and never calls a model. Dates are relative to today, so "Today" in the dashboard is always populated.
