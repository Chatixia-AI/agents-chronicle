# Data and privacy

[← Chronicle](../README.md) · [Docs index](README.md)

**What leaves your machine:** one thing. When a session is analyzed, a condensed digest of it (secrets redacted
first) goes to whatever you chose for analysis: Anthropic with Claude Code (`claude -p`, the default) or OpenAI with
Codex (`codex exec`), through your own login, IBM with Bob Shell (`bob run`) and your Bob API key, or the [model provider](analysis.md#model-providers) you set up, with
your own key (with Ollama on your computer, nothing leaves it). Nothing is sent to Chronicle's authors or any other service, and there is no telemetry. One other
connection is the update check: it asks pypi.org for the latest version number and sends nothing about you. It
runs when you click **Check for updates** on the Status page, and once a day only if you turn on **Check for
updates daily** or **Notify me about new versions** there (both off by default; `chronicle install` asks about
the second). If you connect Codex Cloud, each sync also runs the
`codex cloud` CLI, which fetches your own tasks from OpenAI with your Codex login; nothing is sent the other way.
Importing a claude.ai or ChatGPT export reads only the chats, never the account files (`users.json`, `user.json`).
To warn before a suggested line lands in a public repository, Chronicle runs `gh repo view` with your own `gh` login
for projects with a GitHub remote; that sends GitHub the repository's name and nothing else, and the answer is
remembered for a week. Without `gh` nothing is sent ([Suggestions](suggestions.md#privacy)).

**With your phone and other computers** ([Phone and other computers](devices.md)), nothing leaves your own
devices either: `chronicle tailnet on` makes the dashboard reachable inside your Tailscale network, to your
Tailscale login only. A computer that joined a hub sends it one of two things. With `share = "everything"` (the
default) it sends its **raw session files, unredacted** like the archive: secrets that appeared in a session (a key
pasted in a prompt, a `.env` an agent read) reach the hub and its admins as they are. With `share = "knowledge"` it
sends only summaries and project lessons, made from the redacted digest. Pick `knowledge` for a hub you don't run
yourself. Inside a tailnet, or behind a proxy with HTTPS, the files travel encrypted; over plain `http://` they don't.

## Details

- **The Systems map reads manifests.** To draw what each project is made of, Chronicle reads a short, fixed list of
  files in your project folders, read-only: package manifests, compose files, Dockerfiles, Terraform, GitHub workflows,
  vite configs, `.env.example` and deploy configs, two folder levels deep. Never `.env`, never source code, and
  nothing is stored or sent: the map is rebuilt from them in memory. A git remote is shown without its credentials.
  `[systems] read_manifests = false` turns this off ([Systems map](dashboard.md#systems-map)).
- **Redaction.** API keys, tokens and similar secrets are replaced in the digest before any call. The raw archive
  keeps the original transcripts unchanged, on your disk only. Redaction goes by patterns, so it misses a secret
  that looks like nothing in particular: see [What redaction catches](#what-redaction-catches).
- **Analysis runs sandboxed.** No session is written for the analysis itself, none of your hooks, plugins, MCP
  servers or instruction files load, and the model can only answer. `claude -p` runs with
  `--no-session-persistence --safe-mode --tools "" --strict-mcp-config`; `codex exec` runs `--ephemeral` and
  `--ignore-user-config` in a read-only sandbox with every tool feature off, and Chronicle discards any reply that
  follows a tool call ([details](analysis.md#how-analysis-works)). A model provider gets a plain API request with no
  tools in it. `analysis.auto = false` turns automatic analysis off.
- **Provider API keys** live in `provider-keys.json` in Chronicle's folder (mode 600), not in `config.toml`, and the
  dashboard never sends one back to the browser.
- **The dashboard** binds to 127.0.0.1, rejects foreign `Host` headers (DNS rebinding) and requires a custom header
  on state-changing requests (CSRF). Its page runs only the dashboard's own script files (a Content-Security-Policy),
  so text from a transcript that slipped into the page as HTML could run nothing. In the app window, the page can call only three window actions (theme, drag,
  zoom). Reached through Tailscale Serve, it answers only to the names in `[server] allowed_hosts` and lets in only
  the Tailscale logins in `[server] allowed_users`, a header it trusts only from Serve on the same computer. A
  hub takes other computers' files only with its token (`chronicle hub enable --rotate` replaces it). Reached from
  another device directly (`server.host 0.0.0.0`) or through a reverse proxy, the dashboard opens only for people
  signed in: until a hub has people (`chronicle hub invite`), it answers only this computer itself.
- **On a hub, each computer's sessions stay its own.** A session another computer sent can't be replaced, changed
  or taken back by a different computer, and an invite can't take over a computer that already joined as someone
  else.
- **Exports** (Export on a session, or on a selection in the Sessions list) are redacted, in Markdown and JSON
  ([what that catches](#what-redaction-catches)). **Original transcript** is the agent's own file as archived, unredacted:
  check it before sharing.
- **MCP tools** read the database and answer on stdio; nothing listens on the network. Their results join the
  client's conversation and so reach that client's model, with secrets redacted as in the digests. Give the server
  only to clients whose model provider you trust with your sessions. See [MCP server](mcp.md#privacy).
- **Other agents' stores are only read.** SQLite databases are opened read-only and archived as snapshots; Bob's
  login state is never read, and from Antigravity only conversation logs and Markdown artifacts are archived. Connecting an agent edits its MCP config, backed up to `~/.claude-chronicle/backups/`
  first.
- **Instruction files and `~/.claude.json` are written only when you apply a suggestion.** Chronicle may add a line
  to a `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`, inside its own `<!-- BEGIN chronicle -->` block and nowhere else in the file, or
  add the missing Playwright MCP arguments to `~/.claude.json`. Each file is backed up to
  `~/.claude-chronicle/backups/` first, and **Undo** takes the change back out. Setup steps are only shown; Chronicle
  never runs them or edits your shell startup files. See [Suggestions](suggestions.md).
- **Deleting.** `chronicle forget <id> [--delete-transcript]` removes a session for good; `chronicle uninstall
  --purge` deletes everything.

## What redaction catches

Redaction replaces what matches a list of patterns (`src/chronicle/redact.py`) with `[REDACTED]`. It runs on the
digest sent for analysis and on what analysis writes back (titles, summaries, lessons), and on exports, the Markdown
vault and what the MCP tools answer. It never changes the raw archive, which the dashboard's transcript view shows as
it is on your computer, an **Original transcript** download, or the session files a computer sends a hub with
`share = "everything"`.

**Caught:**

- Private keys (`-----BEGIN … PRIVATE KEY-----` blocks) and JWTs (`eyJ….….…`).
- Keys and tokens with a known prefix: Anthropic (`sk-ant-`), OpenAI (`sk-`), GitHub (`ghp_`, `gho_`, `github_pat_`
  and the like), GitLab (`glpat-`), Slack (`xoxb-` and the like), AWS access key ids (`AKIA`, `ASIA`), Google
  (`AIza`), Databricks (`dapi`), Stripe (`sk_live_`, `rk_test_` and the like), Hugging Face (`hf_`) and npm (`npm_`).
- A value after a secret's name and `=` or `:`: `password`, `passwd`, `pwd`, `secret`, `client_secret`, `api_key`,
  `access_key`, `secret_key`, `auth_token`, `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `private_key` or `token`, also with a
  prefix as in an environment variable (`DB_PASSWORD=`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=`).
- HTTP credentials: `Bearer` tokens, the credential in an `Authorization:` or `Proxy-Authorization:` header
  (`Basic`, `Bearer`, `token`), a password in a URL (`postgres://user:password@host`) or in `curl -u user:password`,
  and cookies (`Cookie:` and `Set-Cookie:` lines, `curl --cookie`).
- Azure keys: `AccountKey=`, `SharedAccessKey=` and a SAS token's `sig=`.

**Not caught:**

- A secret with no known prefix and no name beside it: a password typed on its own, a key pasted without its
  variable, a value under a name not listed above (`DB_PASS=`, `PGUSER_PW=`).
- A secret split across lines, encoded (base64 other than a `Basic` header, URL-encoded), or inside a file an agent
  attached as an image or a PDF.
- Personal data: names, email addresses, phone numbers and the like are left as they are.

When a secret has reached a session, rotate it: redaction keeps it out of what Chronicle shows and sends, not out of
the transcript the agent wrote.
