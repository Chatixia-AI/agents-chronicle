Thanks for helping. Interlatch is a small Python project with no build step for the dashboard.

1. `uv sync && uv run pytest -q` runs the tests in about 40 seconds. They use a fake `claude` binary and synthetic
   Codex, Copilot, Bob and Antigravity stores, so they never touch your real data or spend tokens.
2. `uv run python -m chronicle ui --port 8799` serves the dashboard from your checkout. To work on it without your
   own sessions, build the demo home first (see [Demo data](docs/development.md#demo-data)).
3. `uv run --extra app python -m chronicle app` runs the macOS app from the checkout.
4. `uvx pre-commit install` checks each commit the way CI does: secrets, `ruff check`, the lockfile, the workflows
   ([Pre-commit hooks](docs/development.md#pre-commit-hooks)).

[docs/development.md](docs/development.md) covers the code layout, building the app and releasing.

When you open a pull request, say what changed and how you checked it, and include a screenshot for UI changes
(taken from the demo data, not your own sessions). Please keep all data local: Interlatch must not send anything
anywhere except the analysis calls through the user's own `claude`.

Found a way in rather than a bug? [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) says how to report it privately.

A change users will notice gets its changelog line in a new file in [changelog.d/](changelog.d/README.md), named after
its topic, not in CHANGELOG.md itself. The **Changelog** check fails a pull request that changes `src/`, `ee/src/`,
`docker/` or `vscode-extension/` without one; label it `no-changelog` if nothing changes for users.

Code outside `ee/` is MIT, and so are your contributions to it. `ee/` is under the
[Chronicle Enterprise License](ee/LICENSE), and pull requests to it fall under section 3 of that license. The MIT
core must never import from `ee/` ([ee/README.md](ee/README.md)).
